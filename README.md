<h3>Extended shopping Management</h3>

Project presents a map with clients which contain another map (just for the purpose of the task) with products. On that map I use streams to take out the necessary information.
The project was made in order to gain practice in technologies learned during the course.

The program was written in Java language version 11. To make everything work properly, You need to import the project from my profile on github.
